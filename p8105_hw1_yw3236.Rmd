# Problem 0.1.1

First, I went to GitHub to create a new public repo named p8105_hw1_yw3236. Second, I created a local R project named p8105_hw1_yw3236 by using File > New Project > Version Control and providing the repo URL.

# Problem 0.1.2

First, I created a .Rmd file named p8105_hw1_yw3236 by using File > New File > R Markdown File. Second, I used `knitr::knit` to render a .Rmd file to a .md file (the code is listed below). 

knitr::knit("p8105_hw1_yw3236.Rmd")
